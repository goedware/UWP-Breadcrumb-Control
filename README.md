## Usage
### 1. Home 
The home item is the first item in the breadcrumb control and is always visible. You can specify the home item in 4 different ways:

* Do nothing and use the default template that consists of a SymbolIcon with the *Home* symbol
* Set the **HomeIcon** property. This will display the icon specified in the default template above
* Set the **HomeText** property. This will display text as the Home item
* Set the **HomeTemplate** property. This will display your specified datatemplate as Home item

If *HomeText* is specfied. The control will use that before any template or Icon. If not it will first use the template and else the icon specified.

### 2. Breadcrumb Items 
Breadcrumb items are the items that display your information in the breadcrumb and are selectable. You can specify the items in 2 different ways:

* Set the **DisplayMemberPath** property. This will display the specified member/path of the current datacontext
* Set the **ItemTemplate** property. This will display your specified datatemplate as breadcrumb item

If *ItemTemplate* is specified it will use that instead of any *DisplayMemberPath*.

### 3. Seperator Items 
Seperator items are the items that are displayed between your breadcrumb items and between the Home item and your first crumb. You can specify the items in 3 different ways:

* Do nothing and use the default seperator string */*
* Set the **Seperator** property. This will display the specfied string as seperator
* Set the **SeperatorTemplate** property. This will display your specified datatemplate as seperator item

If *SeperatorTemplate* is specified it will use that instead of *Seperator*.

### 4. Overflow Items 
Overflow items will replace your breadcrumb items when the control is too large (horizontal) to be displayed on the screen. *The last breadcrumb will never transform into an overflow item.* You can specify the items in 3 different ways:

* Do nothing and use the default overflow string *...*
* Set the **OverFlow** property. This will display the specfied string as overflow
* Set the **OverFlowTemplate** property. This will display your specified datatemplate as overflow item

If *OverFlowTemplate* is specified it will use that instead of *OverFlow*.

### 5. Home Selected 
You can specify your own action when the Home item is selected. You can specify the action in 2 different ways:

* Connect to the **HomeSelected** event. This event will occur when the Home item is selected
* Set the **HomeCommand** property. This will execute the command when the home item is selected

```csharp
private void OnHomeSelected(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Do something
}
````

### 6. Item Selected 
You can specify your own action when a breadcrumb item is selected. You can specify the action in 2 different ways:

* Connect to the **ItemSelected** event. This event will occur when a breadcrumb item is selected
* Set the **ItemCommand** property. This will execute the command when breadcrumb item is selected

The event and command will have a **BreadcrumbEventArgs** as parameter that consists of:

* **Item** the current item that is selected
* **ItemIndex** the item index of the item that is selected

```csharp
private void OnItemSelected(object sender, BreadcrumbEventArgs e)
{
    var item = e.Item;
    var index = e.ItemIndex;
}
````

### 7. ItemsSource
You can specify the breadcrumb items of the control by setting the *ItemsSource* property. You can bind any IEnumerable to this control. If you use an ObservableCollection the control will update itself when you add or remove an item in the collection.

### 8 Customization

Customize the about items to your own style by overriding the default templates & styles:

* **ItemStyle:** Override to change the default style of the breadcrumb items
* **HomeItemStyle:** Override to change the default style of the home items
